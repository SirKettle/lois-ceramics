4. Biography / Intro:
My pottery is mainly functional but with a 'twist'. Mostly bowls, jugs and mugs etc, I also make large platters and decorative pieces.  I use earthstone original and special fleck clay, firing to 1260 degrees stoneware and tend to focus on 3 glazes, a beautiful bright blue which has different qualities depending on the clay used, a duck egg blue and a matt white. I decorate mainly with 'wax resist'.
Originally trained as a craft potter under John Dann and Martin Dines in Essex I have now returned to my first love of ceramics, especially throwing and decoration, at my studio in Diss, Norfolk. Visitors, by appointment, are always welcome.
I regularly exhibit my work at craft fairs and events throughout Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire including the Guildhall [Innovations in Ceramic Art] and All Saints in Cambridge, Walberswick, Woodbridge and Ickworth House [National Trust]. I also undertake commissioned work.
